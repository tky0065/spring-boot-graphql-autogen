# ðŸ“ˆ Load Tests

This directory contains resources and documentation for setting up and running load tests for the Spring Boot GraphQL Auto-Generator project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The primary goal of these load tests is to:
- Assess the performance and scalability of the generated GraphQL APIs.
- Identify performance bottlenecks under various load conditions.
- Ensure the API can handle expected user traffic and data volumes.

## ðŸš€ Tools

We recommend using one of the following tools for load testing:
- **Apache JMeter:** A powerful open-source tool for performance testing.
- **Gatling:** A high-performance open-source load testing framework based on Scala.
- **k6:** A developer-centric open-source load testing tool that uses JavaScript for scripting.

## ðŸ“‹ Plan

1.  **Choose a Tool:** Select one of the recommended load testing tools.
2.  **Define Scenarios:** Identify key GraphQL operations (queries, mutations, subscriptions) that need to be tested under load. Consider typical user flows.
3.  **Write Test Scripts:** Develop test scripts for the chosen tool, simulating realistic user behavior.
4.  **Configure Load Profiles:** Define various load profiles (e.g., number of concurrent users, ramp-up period, test duration) to simulate different traffic patterns.
5.  **Execute Tests:** Run the load tests against a deployed instance of the GraphQL API.
6.  **Analyze Results:** Collect and analyze performance metrics (e.g., response times, throughput, error rates, resource utilization).
7.  **Identify Bottlenecks:** Use the analysis to pinpoint areas for optimization in the application or infrastructure.
8.  **Iterate:** Refine the API and re-run tests to validate improvements.

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices

-   **Start Small:** Begin with light loads and gradually increase to identify breaking points.
-   **Monitor Resources:** Keep an eye on CPU, memory, and network usage of the application server and database during tests.
-   **Isolate Tests:** Run tests in an environment that closely mimics production but is isolated from actual production traffic.
-   **Automate:** Integrate load tests into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous performance monitoring.
